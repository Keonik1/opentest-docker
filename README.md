## Building containers
```bash
docker build -f ./DOCKERFILE --target Server -t opentest:server . 
docker build -f ./DOCKERFILE --target Actor -t opentest:actor .
```

## Selenium repo
https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium

## Enabling and disabling video recording
You can record video through the container. The `selenium_chrome_video` container is used for this
When starting the container, the recording function is **disabled**.

After the recording is turned on, the file `chrome_video.mp4` will appear in the `./selenium/video` directory, but you can view it only after the recording is **turned off**.

### Enabling recording
```bash
docker exec selenium_chrome_video supervisorctl start all
```

### Turning off recording
```bash
docker exec selenium_chrome_video supervisorctl stop all
```
